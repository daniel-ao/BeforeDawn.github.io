  <h2><i>What is "BeforeDawn" ?</i></h2>

  <center>
    <p><strong>”Before Dawn” is a <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_defense">Tower Defense</a> game, but
        there are some different. It is a real-time strategy video game played by building turrets or similar buildings
        on the map to stop the game’s enemies from reaching the fortress. BeforeDawn is an exciting and thrilling game
        that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The game is reminiscent of the popular games <a href="https://clashroyale.com/">Clash Royale</a> and <a
          href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warcraft_III:_Reign_of_Chaos">WarCraftIII</a>
        but ,the game has become different to a classic tower defense game; it is no longer a simple defensive computer
        attack; the game now requires the player to train his troops and destroy the enemy's main base through a robust
        military force to win. The whole game gets harder but also more exciting.

  <h2><i>How to play ?</i></h2>
  <br>
  <center>
    <p>
      This is an RTS game where the game aims to destroy the main base of the opposing enemy. Each player has their own
      territory.
      <br>
      Since enemy home bases do not explode on their own, we need to train some soldiers to attack and destroy the enemy
      home base. Soldiers do not grow out of the ground by themselves, so we need to build our own training camps to
      train our soldiers. Of course, training soldiers isn't free, it costs money, so we need to spend in-game 'gold' to
      train soldiers, and gold doesn't come from magic; we need to dig it up in the gold mines.
      <br>
      <br>
      Once the gold is mined, we can do many things, train soldiers, and build defense towers to protect our base.
      <br>
      <br>
      you must mine gold and build defenses to protect your base.
      The game revolves around mining gold and using it to build defenses. You start with a limited amount of gold, but
      as you progress, you can mine more gold and build more elaborate defenses. You can construct walls, turrets,
      traps, and other defenses that will help protect your base from enemy attacks.
      The enemy player is doing the same thing, mining gold and building defenses to protect their base. As the game
      progresses, you must balance the need to mine gold with the need to build defenses. You must also keep an eye on
      your enemy's base and try to find weaknesses in their defenses.
      <br>
      <br>
      The game is as simple as that and very easy to understand.
