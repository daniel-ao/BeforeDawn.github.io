    <h3>Florent JIN</h3>
    <p>
      Hello! My name is Florent JIN and I’m a first-year EPITA student. From my childhood, I have been surrounded by many relatives who loved playing video games. Since I was young, most of the time, I was around watching my cousins play many games on Xbox or even on WII. I got my first phone during my middle school, then I was able to play many mobile games and I find out what I liked and, on the contrary, what I didn't like. With all my experience in mobile games, I realized that I love to play Tower Defense. Thus with this project, I will be able to put all my knowledge acquired in programming to carry out this project.

      Hello! I am Frédéric, a freshman at EPITA. Even if it's my first year, I want to do something that I could be proud of myself when I’m older and say even if it's not perfect that it was worth trying.

    <p>
      Hello, I am Kun Li, a first-year student at EPITA. “Group I” team member. I think games have become more than just games, with the development of our society, games can be a way to provide people with stress relief, they can be e-sports, they can be a healing therapy, they can be all kinds of possibilities, they can be something that exists in human society, or they can be an idea that can't be realized in reality, and games are becoming more and more powerful and unique. So I want to make games.

        This project is mainly a teamwork project because we all work together and split our work to be more efficient. So, this project can teach us how to manage our time as a group as much as how important it is to redistribute all tasks. Communication is an essential factor to carry out our project. As we come from different sections, we must overcome the language barrier by speaking English. Making games gives us a better state of mind, logic, aesthetics, experience, sense of achievement, and a bigger picture. In fact, what we would like to do is, of course, to develop a game independently to our satisfaction. If we develop independently, the necessary planning and design management can exercise our big picture, while the bugs we encounter in the process of making the game and the difficulties we encounter in the learning process will allow us to help each other, asking questions on everything.
